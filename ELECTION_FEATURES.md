## ðŸ›  **API Endpoints**

### New Organization Elections Endpoint
```
GET /api/election/organization
```

**Query Parameters:**
- `search` (string): Search by election title
- `status_filter` (enum): Filter by computed status (upcoming, running, finished)
- `election_type` (string): Filter by election type (simple, district_based, governorate_based)
- `limit` (int): Number of results (1-100, default: 50)
- `offset` (int): Pagination offset (default: 0)

**Response Schema:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Student Council Election 2024",
  "types": "simple",
  "status": "pending",
  "computed_status": "upcoming",
  "starts_at": "2024-03-01T09:00:00Z",
  "ends_at": "2024-03-01T17:00:00Z",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "total_vote_count": 0,
  "number_of_candidates": 5,
  "potential_number_of_voters": 100,
  "method": "csv"
}
```

## ðŸŽ¨ **UI Components**

### ElectionsList Component
- **Location**: `frontend/src/components/ElectionsList.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - Search bar with real-time filtering
  - Status tabs (All, Upcoming, Running, Finished)
  - Type and status dropdown filters
  - Responsive card layout
  - Action buttons (Edit, Delete, View Results)
  - Loading states and error handling

### Integration
- **OrganizationDashboard**: Updated to use the new ElectionsList component
- **API Service**: Enhanced with new endpoint support
- **Authentication**: Fully integrated with organization-level auth

## ðŸ“Š **Election Status Logic**

```javascript
// Status is computed based on current time vs election dates
const now = new Date();
if (now < election.starts_at) {
  status = "upcoming";
} else if (now >= election.starts_at && now <= election.ends_at) {
  status = "running";
} else {
  status = "finished";
}
```

## ðŸ”’ **Security**
- All endpoints require organization-level authentication
- Organizations can only view their own elections
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection protection with SQLAlchemy

## ðŸš€ **Getting Started**

1. **Backend**: Ensure the backend service is running with the latest migration
2. **Frontend**: The new elections tab will automatically show in the organization dashboard
3. **Authentication**: Log in as an organization to access the elections management
